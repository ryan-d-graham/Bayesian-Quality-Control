# Decision-Theoretic Quality Control

This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for calculating and visualizing the posterior distribution of the number of defectives in a lot based on decision-theoretic principles using the Jeffreys prior. It uses `tkinter` for the GUI and `matplotlib` for plotting.

## Features

- Input fields for various parameters like total number of items, sample size, costs, and penalties.
- Calculation of the maximum acceptable number of defectives based on the given parameters.
- Visualization of the prior and posterior distributions.
- Separate buttons for updating the calculation and plotting the results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`
- `tkinter` (usually included with Python installations)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decision-theoretic-quality-control.git
   cd decision-theoretic-quality-control
