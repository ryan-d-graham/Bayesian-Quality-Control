### Bayesian Quality Control with Jeffreys Prior and Quadratic Costs

#### Overview
Bayesian Quality Control is a method to determine the maximum number of defective items (\( m \)) in a sample from a lot that can be accepted based on cost considerations. This approach uses a Jeffreys prior, likelihood calculations, and posterior distributions to make informed decisions.

#### Decision Rule
- Compare the expected accept and reject costs:
  - **Accept the Lot** if the accept cost is less than the reject cost.
  - **Reject the Lot** if the accept cost is greater than or equal to the reject cost.

### Example Manufacturing Scenario

#### Parameters:
- **Lot Size (\( N \))**: 1000 (Total number of widgets in the lot)
- **Sample Size (\( n \))**: 20 (Number of widgets inspected)
- **Cost per Defective Item (\( c \))**: $10 (Cost associated with each defective widget)
- **Penalty Cost Coefficient (\( P \))**: $1 (Additional cost due to lost opportunities or customer dissatisfaction, quadratic penalty)
- **Revenue per Non-Defective Item (\( R \))**: $20 (Revenue generated by each non-defective widget)
- **Inspection Cost (\( I \))**: $100 (Cost of inspecting the lot)
- **Delay or Disruption Cost (\( D \))**: $200 (Cost associated with rejecting the lot due to delays or disruptions)

#### Running the Example

### Command:
```sh
python script.py --lot=1000 --sample=20 --item=10 --penalty=1 --revenue=20 --inspect=100 --delay=200 --plot_prior=true --plot_post=true
